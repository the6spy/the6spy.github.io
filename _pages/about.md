I am a Senior Lecturer in the School of Computer Science and Informatics at Cardiff University, where I have been a member of the Cybersecurity group since June 2022. I also serve as the Deputy Leader of the Cybersecurity Lab, contributing to research, industry collaborations, and student mentorship in the field. My expertise spans Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity, with a particular focus on Federated Learning and securing decentralised, large-scale systems, such as the Internet of Things and Smart Cities. I am also a member of the <a href='https://edgeaihub.co.uk'>National Edge AI Hub</a>, a collaborative initiative dedicated to advancing Edge Computing and AI security. My research interests include cybersecurity modelling for complex systems, utilising techniques such as game theory, epidemiological modelling, viable system modelling, and system dynamics to develop resilient and adaptive security solutions.

Before joining Cardiff University, I gained industry experience at Toshiba Research Europe in Bristol and Airbus in Newport, where I led cybersecurity research strategies and contributed to high-impact projects in the domain like "CAVShield", a feasibility study funded by Innovate UK, and "SWAN: Secure Wireless Agile Networks", a collaborative project with the University of Bristol and "SYNERGIA", an InnovateUK funded project around end-to-end security in large-scale IoT applications.

My academic journey also includes a tenure at the University of the West of England, where my dedication to teaching earned me the Best Teacher of the Year award for the 2018-2019 academic year.

Last but not least, I enjoy photography, travelling and watching anime. :smile:
